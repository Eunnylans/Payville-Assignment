# Linux User and Directory Management for Cloud Infrastructure

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates core Linux system administration skills required for cloud infrastructure environments. The focus is on **user management, group configuration, directory structure creation, and permission control** using standard Linux commands.

The setup simulates a real-world company environment where **access control and organized file systems** are essential for security and operational efficiency.


## Role

**Cloud Engineer**


## Objectives

The primary goals of this task are to:

* Create and manage Linux users
* Assign users to appropriate groups
* Build a structured company directory hierarchy
* Configure secure access permissions
* Apply best practices for Linux access control


## Tasks Performed

### 1. User and Group Management

* Created multiple company users
* Assigned users to relevant groups based on role
* Verified group membership

### 2. Directory Structure Setup

* Created departmental directories for company operations
* Organized directories based on functional roles
* Ensured a logical and scalable directory hierarchy

### 3. Permissions and Access Control
